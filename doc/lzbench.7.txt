NAME

   lzbench - in-memory benchmark of open-source compressors


SYNOPSIS

   usage: lzbench [options] [input]

   where [input] is a file/s or a directory and [options] are:

OPTIONS

   -b#
          set block/chunk size to # KB {default: filesize} (max 1.7GB)
   -c#
          sort results by column # (1=algname,  2=ctime, 3=dtime, 4=comprsize)
   -e#
          #=compressors separated by '/' with parameters specified after ',' {fast}
   -h
          display this help and exit
   -iX,Y
          set min. number of compression and decompression iterations {1, 1}
   -j
          join files in memory but compress them independently (for many small files)
   -l
          list of available compressors and aliases
   -R
          read block/chunk size from random blocks (to estimate for large files)
   -m#
          set memory limit to # MB {no limit}
   -o#
          output text format 1=Markdown, 2=text, 3=text+origSize, 4=CSV {2}
   -p#
          print time for all iterations: 1=fastest 2=average 3=median {1}
   -r
          operate recursively on directories
   -s#
          use only compressors with compression speed over # MB {0 MB}
   -tX,Y
          set min. time in seconds for compression and decompression {1, 2}
   -v
          disable progress information
   -V
          output version information and exit
   -x
          disable real-time process priority
   -z
          show (de)compression times instead of speed

EXAMPLES
   lzbench -ezstd filename = selects all levels of zstd
   lzbench -ebrotli,2,5/zstd filename = selects levels 2 & 5 of brotli and zstd
   lzbench -t3,5 fname = 3 sec compression and 5 sec decompression loops
   lzbench -t0,0 -i3,5 fname = 3 compression and 5 decompression iterations
   lzbench -o1c4 fname = output markdown format and sort by 4th column
   lzbench -j -r dirname/ = recursively select and join files in given directory
