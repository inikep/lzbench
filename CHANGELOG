- improvement: Added the -I# option, which enables compression using # internal (built-in) threads
               when supported. Currently available for the following compressors: bsc, fast-lzma2,
               kanzi, lzham, lzma, xz, and zstd.

v2.1 (Jul 17, 2025)
- Added the -T parameter, which enables multi-threaded compression using an external thread
  pool implemented in lzbench. The input data is split into N blocks (with block size specified
  by the -b option) and each block is compressed independently using T threads. Since the blocks
  are processed independently, this may slightly reduce the compression ratio. This option also
  significantly increases memory usage, as each compressor instance is allocated T times.
