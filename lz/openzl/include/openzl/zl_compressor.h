 *
 * The `ZL_Compressor` object is the core concept of the OpenZL compression
 * engine.
 *
 * A OpenZL compression graph is built out of graphs and nodes.
 *
 * - **graph**: Compresses one or more inputs. All graphs are built out of
 * nodes, except for the unit graph `ZL_GRAPH_STORE` which takes one input and
 * stores it in the compressed frame. OpenZL also provides many commonly used
 * pre-built graphs in `zl_public_nodes.h`. Custom graphs can also be
 * constructed using the @ref ZL_Compressor object. Graphs are compression-time
 * only, so custom graphs can be added any time without impacting the
 * decompressor.
 * - **node**: Transforms one or more inputs into one or more outputs. OpenZL
 *   provides many builtin standard nodes in `zl_public_nodes.h`. Users can also
 *   register custom nodes, however this requires registering a decoder with the
 *   @ref ZL_DCtx in order to decode the data.
