/**
 * @file
 *
 * This file defines functions related to translating between materialized and
 * serialized representations of a compressor. The materialized representation
 * is of course the `ZL_Compressor` you know and love. The serialized
 * representation is a bytestream with, for the moment, a private, unstable
 * format.
 *
 * There are a number of requirements imposed on the structure and contents of
 * a compressor in order for it to be (de-)serializable:
 *
 * - The format is currently unstable. The serialized compressor must have been
 *   generated from the same library version that is deserializing it, or
 *   deserialization will fail.
 *
 * - Serialization doesn't capture everything. Some components of a compressor
 *   are by their nature non-serializable. These components (custom transforms,
 *   custom graphs, refParams, and ownParams) aren't included in the serialized
 *   compressor, but instead the serialized compressor contains references to
 *   them and expects that the compressor into which it is deserialized will
 *   have those same custom components pre-registered and set up in the same
 *   way. In particular:
 *
 *   - Any custom nodes or graphs in which you provide a function pointer as
 *     part of its registration, i.e., those created by calling:
 *
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerPipeEncoder
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerSplitEncoder
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerTypedEncoder
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerVOEncoder
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerMIEncoder
 *
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerFunctionGraph
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerFunctionGraph
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerSerialSelectorGraph
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerSelectorGraph
 *
 *     are non-serializable. You must pre-register the same component on the
 *     compressor onto which you want to deserialize. Furthermore, since the
 *     serialized graph fundamentally identifies relationships between
 *     components by their names, the component must be registered with the
 *     same explicit(!) name on both the source and destination compressors.
 *
 *     TODO: I plan to expose a method that lets you query a serialized
 *     compressor to find out on which components it depends. So you will
 *     (eventually) be able to query the serialized compressor and then
 *     look up and register the needed components into the compressor before
 *     proceeding with deserialization.
 *
 *   - Any node or graph which you have directly parameterized with any
 *     `ZL_RefParam` params is non-serializable. A node or graph created with
 *     `ZL_RefParam` params must, like components created with custom
 *     functions, be pre-registered with the same explicit name on the
 *     destination compressor.
 *
 *     Note that an otherwise serializable graph component which has exactly
 *     the same `ZL_LocalRefParams` as the component from which it was created
 *     is still serializable. (That is, graph components' `ZL_LocalRefParams`
 *     are inherited from the base component of which they are a copy or
 *     modification, rather than being transported in the serialized
 *     representation.)
 *
 *   - `ZL_CopyParam` params must be semantically flat, serial buffers and
 *     should not contain pointers to external data, since they (when they're
 *     set on serializable components) are serialized. That means that the byte
 *     contents of the buffer `ZL_CopyParam` will be provided to the
 *     corresponding component on the destination compressor, which might be
 *     in a different process which doesn't have access to things pointed-to
 *     outside of that buffer.
 *
 *   - Note however that a copy or modification of a non-serializable object
 *     which does not modify any of the non-serializable attributes is generally
 *     serializable! So while the node resulting from registering a custom
 *     transform or graph is non-serializable, any uses of that graph
 *     component, produced by modifying or composing the original
 *     non-serializable component, via, e.g.:
 *
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerParameterizedNode (see note)
 *
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerStaticGraph_fromNode1o
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerStaticGraph_fromPipelineNodes1o
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerStaticGraph_fromNode
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerStaticGraph (see note)
 *     - ZL_Compressor_registerParameterizedGraph (see note)
 *
 *     (Note: the marked APIs let you replace the parameters, and so the above
 *     restrictions on what parameters can be modified)
 *
 * All of this is to say, compressors that you would like to serialize and
 * later reinflate should abide by the following structure:
 *
 * Each custom/non-serializable graph component should be registered once in
 * the compressor under a stable, explicit name. Any use or modification of
 * such a component should copy or modify that single explicitly named base
 * version. Those copies and modifications, and the ways they're used in the
 * compressor will be serialized.
 *
 * I recommend avoiding giving those copies / modifications / compositions
 * explicit names. That gives a nice and simple policy:
 *
 * - The root registrations of custom components get explicit names and must
 *   be registered on both the source and destination compressors.
 *
 * - Non-root or non-custom components shouldn't have explicit names and should
 *   only be created on the source compressor, since they will be serialized
 *   and recreated on the destination compressor.
 *
 * Since @ref ZL_Compressor_registerParameterizedGraph lets you replace the
 * successor graphs, even custom graphs can be registered as single,
 * well-isolated objects independent of how they're used in the overall graph.
 * You can then use @ref ZL_Compressor_registerParameterizedGraph to build a
 * serializable graph structure out of those atoms.
 *
 * This approach lets you minimize the parts of the graph that aren't
 * serialized and maximize the parts that are.
 *
 * # Serialization Format:
 *
 * The wire format for serialized compressors is described here. Note that this
 * format is unstable and subject to change at any time.
 *
 * A serialized compressor is a CBOR-encoded object. CBOR is semi-translatable
 * into JSON. This description will use JSON syntax to illustrate the format,
 * but keep in mind this is for illustrative purposes only and the actual
 * format is the CBOR equivalent.
 *
 * The root structure of a serialized compressor is a map with the following
 * key/value pairs:
 *
 * - "version": a required value identifying the version of the serialization
 *   format that this object is using. Currently this is just the OpenZL
 *   library version expressed as an integer. It therefore also identifies the
 *   library version from which this compressor was serialized.
 * - "params": a map, from string to **Param Set**, described below.
 * - "nodes": a map, from string to **Node Description**, described below.
 * - "graphs": a map, from string to **Graph Description**, described below.
 * - "start": a string, identifying the graph in the graphs map to use as the
 *   starting graph.
 * - "global_params": a **Param Set Identifier**, described below, which
 *   identifies the params to set globally. The identified param set must be
 *
 * For the moment, all of these fields must be present, even if they aren't
 * used.
 *
 * TODO: describe the sub-object formats, and complete this format spec...
