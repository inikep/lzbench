// Segmenter registration
// --------------------------------------------

/* The chunking operation is done by a dedicated object, the Segmenter,
 * similar to yet distinct from Graphs, with dedicated responsibilities.
 *
 * The Segmenter must be registered, like a Graph.
 * Since a Segmenter deals with user Inputs, it typically is the first operation
 * of a Compressor. Alternatively, it can follow any set of Selectors, as long
 * as none of these steps alter user Input in any way.
 *
 * The job of the Segmenter is to decide Chunk Boundaries,
 * determining a unit of work, and pass it down to a selected Successor Graph.
 * Each Chunk can receive a different successor Graph.
 *
 * @note: One downside of this approach is that any information gathered by the
 * Segmenter during its execution isn't automatically available for the
 * following Graph stage. Fortunately, it's still possible to pass it down using
 * runtime parameters, though it then creates a contract between 2 entities.
 *
 * Each Chunk is guaranteed to be processed and output in order.
 * At decompression time, each compressed Chunk is enough to decompress and
 * flush its content, thus allowing streaming during decompression.
 *
 * The Segmenter is allowed to consult Global Parameters and receive Local
 * Parameters that can influence its decisions.
 *
 * A Segmenter context remains valid for the entire compression.
 * Its memory is allocated using session lifetime arena allocator.
 * There is no limit in the number of buffers or structures that can be
 * allocated using this arena. They will all be released at the end of
 * compression. Segmenters are discouraged from using their own allocation, and
 * should use the provided arena allocator instead.
 *
 * @note: extension for Streaming mode (not implemented yet):
 * In streaming mode, a Segmenter is invoked in a loop, defining any number of
 * Chunks per invocation. It manages its own state, in order to resume from a
 * known state. The Input is not necessarily complete, and more data may be
 * provided in subsequent calls. The Segmenter is informed if Input is complete
 * or not. In accumulation mode, a Segmenter is allowed to not create a Chunk
 * with remaining input data, and store it instead, waiting for more data before
 * settling on a Chunk decision. Buffering is an explicit decision, and the
 * Segmenter may receive data from 2 separate buffers in subsequent calls.
 *
 * Occasionally, the segmenter may receive an explicit order to flush all
 * remaining data, in which case, it *must* generate one or more Chunks with
 * whatever data is left from Input.
