/* Transform's State Management (advanced)
 * This can be used to cache a Transform's state within a ZL_CCtx*
 * and keep re-using it across iterations as an optimization
 * in order to save on allocation and initialization costs.
 * Note: currently, a single state is created per Transform.
 * It is then re-used across all compatible nodes present in the Graph.
 *
 * A Transform's state is identified by its 3 components,
 * @stateAlloc, @stateFree and @optionalStateID.
 * If 2 Transforms share the exact same State definition,
 * it's assumed they are compatible and share the same state.
 *
 * @optionalStateID is optional and, if none provided, will be automatically
 * filled by using @transform_f as a key. If you wish 2 different transforms to
 * nonetheless share the same state, provide the same @optionalStateID for both.
 *
 * It's advisable to avoid sticky parameters presumed static across sessions,
 * prefer setting all parameters explicitly at each session,
 * this makes it safer to share states across compatible transforms.
 * If sticky parameters are necessary, ensure that the state will be used for
 * this transform only, by providing a unique @optionalStateID.
 * This unicity must be ensured not just within a single cgraph,
 * but across all cgraph that a same ZL_CCtx* might reference.
 * It's up to the user to ensure ID unicity. When in doubt, do not use the
 * caching system, prefer creating a new state from within the transform.

 * Typed Transforms
 * ------------------------------------
 * Typed Transforms are roughly equivalent to Split transforms.

 *
 * The nb N of outputs is static at declaration time.
 * Once declared, the transform *must* generate as many outputs as declared.
 *
 * The declaration model starts with an @ZL_TypedGraphDesc structure,
 * which explains the split operation and type of the transform, and its ID.
 * It's designed to be shared on both compression and decompression sides.
 *
 * The encoder must require the creation of output streams during its execution,
 * using method @ZL_Encoder_createTypedStream().
 * It's also in charge of determining how many elts it may possibly need to
 * store into each output stream. However, it cannot change the base type
 * (declared in ZL_TypedGraphDesc).
 *
 * The Encoder Interface is also in charge of committing
 * how many elts were actually written into each output stream,
 * using @ZL_Output_commit(), or another write function with included commit.
 * It's allowed to commit `0` bytes.
 * Not committing anything is considered an error.
 *
 * Parameter queries, both global and local, are possible via @ectx.
 *
 * ZL_TypedEncoderFn @return value :

 *
 * In contrast to Typed Transform,
 * the order in which input Streams are presented to the _decoding_ transform
 * is not described in the Graph declaration.
 * The decoding transform will receive input Streams in the same order as
 * the encoding transform created its output Streams.
 *
 * Stream order is therefore a contract between the encoder and decoder.
 * The decoder must document which stream is compulsory, or optional,
 * and in which order they must be presented, or how they are declared.
 * The encoder will then have to respect this contract
 * by issuing creation of its output streams in the correct order.
 * Usage of Private Headers can be useful to describe complex scenarios.
