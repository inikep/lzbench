 * The frame fomat version tells zstrong which frame format to
 * encode or decode. This is important to ensure forward and
 * backward compatibility with previous releases. The frame
 * format number must be bumped if any of the following happen
 * between releases:
 * - The frame format is changed (e.g. frame header changes)
 * - A standard Node is added or removed
 * - A standard Node changes its public ID
 * - A standard transform makes a breaking change to its format
 *
 * The following are not allowed to be changed:
 * - Standard transforms must not change their graph
 *   description. E.g. They must maintain the same number of
 *   inputs & outputs, and the same type for eacy input & output.
 *   To change the type of the transform, you must add a new
 *   transform and delete the old one.
