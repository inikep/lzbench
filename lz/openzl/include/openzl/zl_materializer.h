     * @brief A custom function that materializes an in-memory object from a
     * provided @p params object.
     *
     * This function may arbitrarily use none, any, or all of the provided
     * local params to generate the materialized object, but the generation
     * MUST be deterministic and hermetic. In particular, materialization shall
     * not depend on variables other than the provided @ref ZL_LocalParams
     * object.
     *
     * Materialized object lifetimes will be managed by the @ref ZL_Compressor
     * on which the node is registered/parameterized. Objects will be
     * materialized around the time of node registration/parameterization and
     * will remain allocated for the lifetime of the associated @ref
     * ZL_Compressor.
     *
     * Do NOT rely on the materialization function being called at any specific
     * time to do side-effect work. Doing so will result in undefined behavior.
     *
     * The @ref ZL_Compressor may arbitrarily share the same materialized object
     * between multiple nodes with the same @p params and the @ref ZL_CCtx may
     * provide concurrent access to materialized objects. DO NOT attempt to
     * modify the materialized object after creation, either directly or via API
     * getters.
     *
     * @param matCtx A pointer to a materializer context object associated with
     * the @ref ZL_Compressor. The materialization function may use this to
     * request managed memory from the ZL_Compressor as an alternative to
     * managing allocations itself and via the dematerializeFn.
     * @param params  A pointer to the local params object to materialize. The
     * provided params have no lifetime guarantees past the invocation of this
     * function. You may not hold references into the params object in the
     * materialized object.
     *
     * @returns A ZL_RESULT containing a pointer to the materialized object on
     * success, or an error. Returning NULL as a valid result (when there's
     * nothing to materialize) should be wrapped in ZL_WRAP_VALUE(NULL). Ensure
