/* ------------------------------------
 * Simple ZL_Type_serial input selector
 * ------------------------------------
 *
 * This is a specialized (yet relatively common) scenario,
 * where the custom selector accepts 1 buffer of bytes (ZL_Type_serial) as
 *input. It then redirects it to another Graph, respecting the same input
 *condition (ZL_Type_serial input)
 *
 * The successor can be any compatible Graph the selector wishes,
 * and can be either Standard of Custom.
 *
 * @customGraphs is only needed to specify a list of Custom Graphs
 * that the selector may choose from as successor at runtime
 * even though the actual GraphID can't be known at compile time
 * (the custom Graph must be registered first, which is done at runtime).
 *
 * When no Custom Graph is needed, the list can be empty,
 * and @customGraphs can be NULL.
 *
 * The content and meaning of @customGraphs array is a contract
 * between the custom selector and its registration operation.
 * To reduce chances of employing an incorrect index,
 * it's recommended to publish a list of `enum` alongside the selector
 * description giving a readable meaning to each index value.
 *
 * The function **MUST** be successful, that's its contract.
 * It has to return a compatible `ZL_GraphID`.
 * It means the selector is _not allowed to fail_.
 * For example, if the selector is unable to make sense of the input data,
 * it should still decide what to do with it.
 * (note that standard LZ codecs can always be used for any input,
 * and therefore make good backup successors).
 *
 * Design note : we could imagine a specific GraphID which could mean "error",
 * then the orchestrator would be allowed to take over
 * and select to do whatever it wants with this input stream.
 * In practice, it will be enough to design a "backup GraphID",
 * which could start its life by delegating to LZ without questioning,
 * and then later integrate some "light" selectors able to distinguish simple
 * situations.
 *
 * Design note 2 : since the selector is allowed to choose any Graph it wants as
 * successor, it's more difficult to ensure that successors are valid at CGraph
 * stage. There are a few ways to deal with this situation :
 * - Force the declaration of successors, even when they are standard nodes.
 *   This way, CGraph can validate that all possible successors are valid.
 *   To ensure that the successor is necessarily part of the list,
 *   it would have to be expressed as an index in this list.
 *   Note that the index could still be wrong (out of range),
 *   requiring the orchestrator to deal with it.
 *   More importantly, an index is another indirection level towards a GraphID,
 *   and a raw index value can be "less expressive" than a Graph name,
 *   making the code more complex to read and maintain.
 * - Detect when a successor is incorrect at orchestrator level,
 *   and decide what to do with this situation.
 *   In debug mode, it's a good reason to abort() and output a decent
 *   explanation. In production mode, we may have to choose between failing,
 *   i.e. bubble up an error, or using a backup node to let the compression
 *   process finish the work, at reduced effectiveness. The toggle between
 *   these modes will likely be triggered by some global parameter. Even in this
 *   last case, it's likely that some sort of log should be filled to explain
 *   that a selector has been behaving incorrectly, allowing some maintenance
 *   process to take over and fix the issue.
 *
 * Note 1 : This variant is only compatible with ZL_Type_serial inputs.
 *          Other types of input (ZL_Type_numeric, ZS2_Type_structs, etc.) are
 *          not compatible.
 *
 * Note 2 : This simple variant can only take decisions based on input's
 *          content. It is unable to query any parameter, neither global nor
 *          local. It is also unable to register some of its analysis as
 *          metadata for successor node. Such increased capability set is
 *          available for TypedSelector.

 *      heavyweight approach, and then gradually gain some efficiency, For
 *      example, by storing locally compression outcomes, in order to
 *      re-employ them after selection, and then, when applicable, by delegating
 *      to estimation functions, skipping the actual compression job. Later
 *      efficiency improvements could be brought transparently.

 *      In the future, it may provide additional information,

 *      but may have to change in the future.
 *      In which case, the `const` property of @selCtx will be dropped.
 *      (note: it's currently useful to prevent selectors from requesting
