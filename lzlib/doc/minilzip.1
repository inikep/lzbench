.TH MINILZIP "1" "January 2025" "minilzip 1.15" "User Commands"
.SH NAME
minilzip \- reduces the size of files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B minilzip
[\fI\,options\/\fR] [\fI\,files\/\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
Minilzip is a test program for the compression library lzlib. Minilzip is
not intended to be installed because lzip has more features, but minilzip is
well tested and you can use it as your main compressor if so you wish.
.PP
Lzip is a lossless data compressor with a user interface similar to the one
of gzip or bzip2. Lzip uses a simplified form of LZMA (Lempel\-Ziv\-Markov
chain\-Algorithm) designed to achieve complete interoperability between
implementations. The maximum dictionary size is 512 MiB so that any lzip
file can be decompressed on 32\-bit machines. Lzip provides accurate and
robust 3\-factor integrity checking. 'lzip \fB\-0\fR' compresses about as fast as
gzip, while 'lzip \fB\-9\fR' compresses most files more than bzip2. Decompression
speed is intermediate between gzip and bzip2. Lzip provides better data
recovery capabilities than gzip and bzip2. Lzip has been designed, written,
and tested with great care to replace gzip and bzip2 as general\-purpose
compressed format for Unix\-like systems.

.PP
If no file names are given, or if a file is '\-', minilzip compresses or
decompresses from standard input to standard output.
Numbers may be followed by a multiplier: k = kB = 10^3 = 1000,
Ki = KiB = 2^10 = 1024, M = 10^6, Mi = 2^20, G = 10^9, Gi = 2^30, etc...
Dictionary sizes 12 to 29 are interpreted as powers of two, meaning 2^12 to
2^29 bytes.
.PP
The bidimensional parameter space of LZMA can't be mapped to a linear scale
optimal for all files. If your files are large, very repetitive, etc, you
may need to use the options \fB\-\-dictionary\-size\fR and \fB\-\-match\-length\fR directly
to achieve optimal performance.
.PP
To extract all the files from archive 'foo.tar.lz', use the commands
\&'tar \fB\-xf\fR foo.tar.lz' or 'minilzip \fB\-cd\fR foo.tar.lz | tar \fB\-xf\fR \-'.
.PP
Exit status: 0 for a normal exit, 1 for environmental problems
(file not found, invalid command\-line options, I/O errors, etc), 2 to
indicate a corrupt or invalid input file, 3 for an internal consistency
error (e.g., bug) which caused minilzip to panic.
.PP
The ideas embodied in lzlib are due to (at least) the following people:
Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv (for the LZ algorithm), Andrei Markov (for the
definition of Markov chains), G.N.N. Martin (for the definition of range
encoding), Igor Pavlov (for putting all the above together in LZMA), and
Julian Seward (for bzip2's CLI).
