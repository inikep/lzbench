Changes in version 1.15:

Lzlib now reports a nonzero first LZMA byte as a LZ_data_error.

minilzip now exits with error status 2 if any empty member is found in a
multimember file.

LZ_Errno, LZ_Encoder, and LZ_Decoder are now declared in lzlib.h as typedef.

The targets 'lib' and 'bin' have been added to Makefile.in. 'lib' is the new
default and builds just the library. 'bin' builds both the library and
minilzip.

minilzip is no longer built by default.

'install-bin' installs minilzip and its man page again.

To improve portability, the linker option '--soname' is now used conditionally.
(Reported by Michael Sullivan).

The use of the target 'bin' has been documented in INSTALL.
