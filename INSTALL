Installation
------------
These are generic building and installation instructions.


Requirements
------------
Compilation requires a C and C++ compiler, that is GNUC compatible,
like GCC, LLVM/Clang, ICC.
GCC is available at http://gcc.gnu.org.


Procedure
---------
Download zip or tar ball from repository or release page.

Unpack the archive:

	unzip lzbench-master.zip
or
	tar -xzf lzbench-[version].tar.gz

This creates the directory ./lzbench-[version] containing the source
from the main archive.


Compilation
-----------
Change to lzbench directory and run make.

	make


To order static or dynamic linking set BUILD_STATIC to 1, or 0 respectively:

	make BUILD_STATIC=1

For 32-bit compilation:

	make BUILD_ARCH=32-bit

With certain, old compilers, systems or combintion some compressor
may cause issues. Most of it should be chosen automatically but in
case of problems, particular compressors can be excluded from build setting
DONT_BUILD_XXX to 1, where XXX is target compressor, for example:

	make DONT_BUILD_GLZA=1


Known issues
------------
With all issues refer to Makefile, they may be solved already.
Examples of basic issues (these should be chosen automatically):

LZSSE requires 64-bit CPU to compile and run.
GLZA does not work with GCC < 4.9 and Clang < 3.6.
ZLING requires C++14.
Problematic codecs include TORNADO.
Other to be wary on old or 32-bit systems: CSC, LZHAM, SNAPPY.

Llvm/clang version <= 5 or so, does not like attribute((always_inline))
functions. To solve it add to DEFINES in Makefile:
	DEFINES += -D__extern_always_inline='extern __always_inline'

Libdeflate may not compile with gas < 2.26 or so, with error like:
	Assembler messages:
	Error: no such instruction: 'vpxord %zmm5,%zmm5,%zmm5'
If so, it requires binutils update to version 2.26+.
